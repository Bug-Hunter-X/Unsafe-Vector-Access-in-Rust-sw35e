This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and vector access. The `bug.rs` file contains code that uses `get_unchecked` to modify a vector without bounds checking. This can lead to undefined behavior if the index is invalid. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a safer alternative using standard library methods to avoid the potential for panics and crashes.  This example highlights the importance of careful handling of unsafe code to ensure program stability and reliability.
